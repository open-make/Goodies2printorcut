# Bookmark design

In this document, we will detail the different versions of the bookmark design.

## Introduction

The Long Night of Sciences in Berlin is a flagship event that brings together science enthusiasts, families, students, and professionals for a night dedicated to discovery and innovation.

For this event, we aimed to offer goodies that are not only appealing and memorable but also environmentally responsible. Our goal is to design promotional items that are both useful and durable, aligning with the values of sustainability and environmental respect. To achieve this objective, we have chosen to create eco-friendly bookmarks. In addition to their daily utility, bookmarks are items that can convey important messages while remaining practical. However, for them to be truly durable, it is essential to design them with solid, high-quality materials.

In this introduction, we will detail our initial thoughts regarding the content, size, and materials to be used for our bookmarks.

The first question was about the size of the bookmark, after some research we discovered that they are traditionally 3 sizes of bookmark. The standard sizes of a bookmark are 55 x 173 mm, 50 x 150 mm or for larger ones 52 x 210 mm. We choose 50 x 150 mm because it will be easier to do multiples at the same time.

Our first idea was to demonstrate the capabilities of our machine, showcasing both engraving and cutting features. Additionally, we want to incorporate symbols of Berlin, such as the skyline with its iconic landmarks. This design element will add a local touch and make the bookmarks more meaningful to attendees. We also plan to find a font similar to that of the Technical University of Berlin to maintain a cohesive aesthetic. Moreover, the bookmarks will feature the logos of the Technical University of Berlin (TUB) and Open.make, highlighting our collaboration and commitment to innovative, sustainable practices. By combining these elements, we aim to create a bookmark that is not only functional and durable but also a beautiful memento of the Long Night of Sciences in Berlin.

## First version: with engraving

### On canva

After finding out about the long night of science, it turns out that there are no German-speaking people. We therefore decided to remove the part in English.

### On Inkscape

We then went to Inkscape to transform it into the .svg format needed to engrave. We take the opportunity to change the font for finer letters and for a Berlin skyline with only the main elements.

### Results

Here are some results which are clearly not satisfactory.

It takes 15 minutes to make 1 bookmark and we cannot stack them to make several at once. This is too long.

We therefore decided to only use the cut function, which is faster and with a better result, so we have to completely change the design

## Second version: only cut

### On inkscape

We will then try to make the letters of the Open.make logo visible even if we cut the O and the P to do this and create bridges so that the inside of the letters are visible.

The Berlin skyline also looks very weakened on the paper so we are going to create bridges.

For the moment this is the final version, but other improvements can be made such as adding bridges on the skylines and reducing the Berliner Fernsehturm because the bookmark is very fragile.

### Results

Cutting takes 4 minutes and we can put 3 papers at a time but there is a big problem the smoke leaves traces on the bookmark and in addition to not being clean it stains therefore cannot be used in a book.

We must therefore review the speed and power and only worry about one sheet at a time and not pile them up.

After a few tries, we found that the minimum power was 8% to mark the paper. We then lowered the speed until we had a suitable result.

Finally, for a power of 8% (the minimum):

\- speed at 2% everything is cut without trace of smoke (clean line)

\- speed at 3% the paper is marked and it can be cut with a little force (clean line)

-   speed at 4% the paper is marked and can not be cut (somewhat fast speed for clear results).

To solidify the bookmark, we are adding bridges to the Berlin Skyline.

Here's the result.

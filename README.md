# Open source Goodies

This repository presents open source hardware goodies (initially developed for the LNDW outreach event in Berlin) to 3d print or laser cut.

## Objective

Promoting the principles of open source technology and introducing its potential to a wide audience.

Our goals also include educating the public on how laser cutting technology works and its applications for individuals, researchers and small businesses.

## Vision

We want to provide an engaging and interactive space for attendees to learn about the power and versatility of laser cutting technology and get to understand how open source hardware can leverage this knowledge and facilitate reuse and co-creation.

This may include live demonstrations, hands-on workshops, educational displays, projects and discussions on future innovations.

## License

Hardware products are shared using the CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Permissive, CERN-OHL-P. This means you are free to use, study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs.

Restriction: Due to time constrains and absence of knowledge, we obtained the Berlin skyline design used in the bookmark from canva.com: it comes with a license to use for non commercial purposes, so I think technically we would not be allowed to show it here, as it might be considered distribution. If you want to use it (even for non-commercial purpose), please contact canva.com directly to get a license for yourself. We plan on using a different design in the future.
